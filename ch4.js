let numberVariable = 0;

numberVariable = numberVariable + 1;
numberVariable = numberVariable + 1;
numberVariable = numberVariable + 1;

console.log(numberVariable); // 3


//a prime example of why let is used instead of const 
//if const was used here, varuable would not be allowed to itterate +1, but let can
